# How to reproduce
```
git clone git@github.com:aratare-jp/shadow-cljs-require.git

yarn install

yarn shadow-cljs server
```

Then move on to the dashboard, compile and open the app normally.

You should see this error popping up in the console:
```
Uncaught (in promise) Module not provided: ./assets/plus.js
```
